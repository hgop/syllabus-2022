# Syllabus (Practial part overview)
 
# Grading
 
- Projects - 75% (graded in pairs)
- Exam 25% (All information regarding the lectures, exam and exam material can be found in Canvas)
 
# Overview
The practical part of the course is split into 3 parts (one per week). Each week's project is turned in on Fridays and graded before the next week starts.
 
The 3 projects are a continuation of the previous one so if students are unable to finish the project for a particular week they can start from a base that is given before the next week starts.
 
# Schedule
*Practial classes 13:30-15:30 (Mon-Thu):* In a classroom and via Zoom (for those that are unable to make it)

# Practical Information
 
## About
The projects are focused on a practical application of software quality assurance and testing. The aim is to empower students to set up their own development pipeline using continuous delivery and testing.
 
## Prerequisites
- Heavily recommended to use either Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS.
  
  For Windows users we recommend setting up a Ubuntu dual boot, any virtual environment or a bootable Ubuntu USB.
- Any code editor of choice (VsCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)
 
## Project work
The projects should be worked on and handed in in groups of two. Please make sure to strive for equal contribution from both parties. Make sure that all parts of your solution can be worked on on both machines and the Git history reflects your equal participation. (if two people per group is not possible please contact the TAs).

Your code and answers should be pushed to Git and you turn in your Github repository url. Make sure to send invites to all TA's.
The solutions are handed in on Fridays, they're graded over the weekend and next week's assignment will be posted before the start of the next week, no sooner than Sundays. Furthermore, TA's will publish base solutions to build on for the next week in case students weren't able to finish the previous week.

We always recommend reviewing the base solutions to make sure you have a solid foundation for the week.
 
## Getting help
The schedule lists the practical classes for the project work. However, since it's only a limited time once per day, we recommend using Github Issues as much as possible. Week 1 assignment will describe how. Often other students can help and we encourage all students to answer Issues that arise and contribution can count towards your grade. TA's will check Issues at least twice a day.
